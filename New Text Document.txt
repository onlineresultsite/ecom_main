It looks like your application is serving static files and media files correctly, but there might still be issues related to database permissions or other aspects of your Django app. The initial issue was regarding database write permissions, so let's ensure that everything related to database permissions and configurations is correctly set up.

Steps to Diagnose and Fix the Issue
Ensure Correct Database Permissions:
Make sure that the db.sqlite3 file and the directory it's in have the correct permissions and ownership.

bash
Copy code
sudo chown ubuntu:ubuntu /home/ubuntu/ecom_main/db.sqlite3
sudo chmod 664 /home/ubuntu/ecom_main/db.sqlite3
sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /home/ubuntu/ecom_main
sudo chmod 775 /home/ubuntu/ecom_main
Check Database Directory Permissions:
Sometimes the directory containing the database file needs proper permissions:

bash
Copy code
sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu /home/ubuntu/ecom_main
sudo chmod -R 775 /home/ubuntu/ecom_main
Restart the Django Application:
After ensuring the permissions are set correctly, restart your Django application:

bash
Copy code
cd /home/ubuntu/ecom_main
source /home/ubuntu/env/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
Check the Database Path in Settings:
Ensure that the database path in your Django settings is correct and points to the writable location:

python
Copy code
# settings.py
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    }
}
Logs for Detailed Errors:
Check the logs for any other detailed errors that might give you more insight into what might be going wrong. You can find the logs in the directory where your application is running or use a log management tool.

Example Logging and Diagnostic Script
Here's a simple bash script you can use to check permissions and ownership:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

PROJECT_DIR="/home/ubuntu/ecom_main"
DB_FILE="$PROJECT_DIR/db.sqlite3"

# Log start time
echo "Diagnostic script started at $(date)"

# Check and set permissions for the project directory
echo "Setting permissions for project directory..."
sudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu $PROJECT_DIR
sudo chmod -R 775 $PROJECT_DIR

# Check and set permissions for the database file
if [ -f $DB_FILE ]; then
  echo "Setting permissions for database file..."
  sudo chown ubuntu:ubuntu $DB_FILE
  sudo chmod 664 $DB_FILE
else
  echo "Database file not found!"
fi

# Log end time
echo "Diagnostic script completed at $(date)"
Save this script as diagnose_permissions.sh, make it executable, and run it:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x diagnose_permissions.sh
./diagnose_permissions.sh
